The article discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's belief that Tesla's full self-driving system is the most advanced, and mentions that Tesla's FSD is powered by Nvidia chips. Additionally, the article notes that most of Nvidia's Data Center revenue comes from consumer internet customers, including cloud providers like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. This suggests that Microsoft is a significant customer of Nvidia, which could positively impact Nvidia's stock value.
