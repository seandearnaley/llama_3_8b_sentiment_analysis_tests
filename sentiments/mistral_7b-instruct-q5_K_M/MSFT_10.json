The article mentions that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes Tesla's full self-driving is the most advanced system out right now, and that Tesla's FSD is powered by Nvidia chips. This suggests a positive sentiment towards Nvidia's technology and partnership with Tesla. Additionally, the article mentions that most of Nvidia's Data Center revenue came from consumer internet customers, including cloud providers like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. This suggests that Microsoft is a significant customer of Nvidia and could potentially benefit from Nvidia's technology. However, the article does not provide specific information about Microsoft's stock value or potential short-term performance.",
