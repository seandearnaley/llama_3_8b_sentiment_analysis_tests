The article mentions that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes Tesla's full self-driving is the most advanced system out right now and that Tesla's FSD is powered by Nvidia chips. This suggests a positive sentiment towards Nvidia, which in turn could have a positive impact on Microsoft's stock value as Microsoft is one of Nvidia's hyperscaler customers. Additionally, the article mentions that most of Nvidia's Data Center revenue came from consumer internet customers, including cloud providers like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. This further supports the idea that Microsoft could benefit from a positive sentiment towards Nvidia.",
